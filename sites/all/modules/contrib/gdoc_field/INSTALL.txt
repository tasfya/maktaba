Gdoc_field is an extension to the core field module, which must be enabled.

1. Unpack the gdoc_field folder and contents in the appropriate modules
   directory of your Drupal installation.  This is probably
   sites/all/modules/
2. Enable the gdoc_field module in the administration tools. It appears
   in the Modules list as "Embedded Google Docs Viewer."
